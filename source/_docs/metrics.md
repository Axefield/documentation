This tool currently provides metrics on **site visits** and **pages served**. Data is gathered every day at midnight.

## Site Visits
Site visits refer to the total amount of unique traffic (IP and user agent) to your site in a 24 hour period, excluding known bots and crawlers.

1. Navigate to the Site Dashboard and select the **<span class="glyphicons glyphicons-cardio"></span> Live** environment.
2. Go to the **<span class="glyphicons glyphicons-charts"></span> Metrics** tool.
3. Select the period of time you'd like to review for **Site Visits** (Day, Week, or Month):

If you prefer the command line, you can use [Terminus](/docs/terminus) to view site visits:

    terminus ..... <site>.<env>

## Pages Served
Pages served is the total number of responses generated by WordPress or Drupal that is served to a visitor. This includes cached responses and non-HTML responses such as JSON.

1. Navigate to the Site Dashboard and select the **<span class="glyphicons glyphicons-cardio"></span> Live** environment.
