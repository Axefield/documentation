## Available Metrics
Metrics include **visits** and **pages served** for the site's Live environment, with data refreshed daily.
<dl>
  <dt>Visits</dt>
    <dd>Total amount of unique traffic (IP and user agent) to your site in a 24 hour period, excluding known bots and crawlers.</dd>
  <dt>Pages Served</dt>
    <dd>Total number of responses generated by WordPress or Drupal that is served to a visitor. This includes cached responses and non-HTML responses such as JSON.</dd>
</dl>
For example, imagine two visitors go to `example.com`. The first visitor exits from the home page, but the second visitor continues to browse two additional pages. This would be tracked as 2 visits and 4 pages served.
