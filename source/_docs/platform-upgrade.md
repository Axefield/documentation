title: Platform Upgrade in Progress
description: Details on the current infrastructure maintenance.
---
Pantheonâ€™s multi-tenant platform uses containers and runs on top of dedicated infrastructure. To ensure optimal performance and security of this infrastructure, we periodically conduct upgrades. 

If your site dashboard displays **Upgrade In Progress** message, it means we are working on our commitment to provide you and your customers the best website mangement platform possible.

## FAQs
### What about my site uptime?

We have built enough redundancy to make sure your site visitors will still be able to visit your site while maintenance is in progress. Read [High Availability At Pantheon](https://pantheon.io/platform/high-availability) to learn more.

We expect zero or minimal downtime for sites.

### Can I access my site dashboard?

Yest, you can access your site dashboard and use all those awesome in-built tools.

To experience a smooth interaction with your dashboard and the development tools, we recommend that you do not push code during the maintenance window. The maintenance window can be anywhere between 10 to 30 minutes depending on various factors, such as volume of your site components (file size, db), time of the day etc.
